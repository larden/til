# How to generates preprocessor output with GCC

To see what are dependencies for the given file, add `-M` to compilation flags.
```
	gcc -M main.c
```

It generates output similar to:
```
main.o: include/include1.h \
	include/include2.h
```

To show output generated by preprocessor add `-E` flag:
```
	gcc -E main.c
```
